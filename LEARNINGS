PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer vs PropertyOverrideConfigurer

EntityManagerFactory vs SessionFactory
EntityManager vs Session
	First one is directly proportional to a single persistence context - manages crud on all the entities defined in that
	Second one is hibernate implementation - manages crud - more CascadeTypes than first one
	
JPATemplate vs HibernateTemplate	-	Different Spring Templates has most of the common routines (standard vs implementation)

All hibernate related property (dialect,show_sql) configurations can be given in persistence unit definition.
PersistenceUnit name defined should be supplied to EntityManagerFactory in constructor

PersistenceUnit TransactionType
ResourceLocal vs JTA
	First one provides basic JDBC Level transaction - provided by JPA Implementation
	Second one provides general purposes like JMS	- provided by application servers/EE containers


JNDI Datasource
	java naming and directory interface - api - java clients look via a name - 
	reduces visibility of database details to developers
	
	
JpaDaoSupport and HibernateDaoSupport - not required in Spring 3
